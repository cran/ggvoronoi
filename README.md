# ggvoronoi: Voronoi Diagrams and Heatmaps with 'ggplot2'

## Overview

'ggvoronoi' allows for easy creation and manipulation of Voronoi diagrams. Nearest neighbor regions are calculated using 'deldir'. From there, visualization is provided with 'ggplot2', or the user can analyze the diagram using any of R's spatial packages.

## Getting started

```r
#installing ggvoronoi from CRAN
install.packages("ggvoronoi")

#view some examples and create your first Voronoi diagram!
vignette("ggvoronoi")
```
